# Folder-Based File Importer in Houdini: Technical Insights

The **Folder-Based File Importer** is a custom Houdini Digital Asset (HDA) designed to streamline the process of importing multiple files from folders directly into Houdini. The tool leverages Python to provide flexibility, scalability, and efficiency for handling large datasets, making it particularly valuable for workflows involving `.obj`, `.fbx`, and `.abc` files.

## Key Technical Features

### Batch Importing with Subfolder Scanning
- The tool can scan directories recursively, including subfolders, to locate and import files with user-specified extensions.
- It uses multithreading (`ThreadPoolExecutor`) to speed up folder traversal, ensuring smooth performance even with deeply nested directories.

### Dynamic File Management
- Users can enable or disable specific file formats (e.g., `.obj`, `.fbx`) through simple checkbox parameters.
- The tool dynamically updates Houdini's Multiparm Block with the discovered files, providing a clear and organized list within the interface.

### Error Handling and Feedback
- Robust error handling ensures users are informed of invalid paths, permission issues, or unsupported formats through both console messages and pop-up alerts.
- The `log_message` and `log_error` functions centralize logging, improving maintainability and debugging.

### Parallel Processing
- By using parallel processing for scanning subfolders, the tool minimizes bottlenecks when dealing with large or complex directory structures.

### Customizable Interface
- Parameters like geometry scaling, rotation, and object margin allow users to fine-tune how imported assets are displayed and adjusted in the Houdini scene.
- Metadata display options include toggling file names and attributes, which are particularly useful for managing large datasets.

## Development Process and Design Choices

### Folder Scanning Logic
- The script includes a flexible `scan_folder` function that supports both recursive and non-recursive file discovery.
- By using Python's `os` module (`scandir` and `walk`), the tool ensures compatibility across different operating systems.

### Multithreading for Performance
- The integration of `ThreadPoolExecutor` allows for concurrent scanning of subfolders, significantly reducing the time required to process directories with numerous subdirectories.
- This approach balances workload across multiple threads, making the tool efficient even for extensive data imports.

### User Experience Enhancements
- The script uses Houdini's UI components (`hou.ui.displayMessage`) to provide immediate feedback, making the tool intuitive for both beginners and advanced users.
- Parameters are cached and reused during execution, improving script performance and reducing overhead.

### Scalable Architecture
- The use of a mapping (`extension_mapping`) for file formats makes it easy to extend support for additional file types in the future.
- Modular functions, such as `import_files_from_folder` and `refresh_import`, encapsulate specific tasks, adhering to clean coding principles.

## Advantages for Production Workflows

### Time Savings
- Automating the import process eliminates repetitive manual work, especially when dealing with hundreds or thousands of assets.

### Error Reduction
- The automated system reduces the chances of missing files or importing incorrect formats, ensuring a consistent pipeline.

### Enhanced Scalability
- The tool's multithreaded design and support for large datasets make it suitable for production environments where efficiency and reliability are paramount.

### Customization and Flexibility
- Users can adjust the tool's parameters to match their specific needs, from geometry scaling to file selection.

## Performance Comparison

In a real-world project test, the **Folder-Based File Importer** showed an execution time of **2.396s**, while the standard **File Merge SOP** took **2.625s**.

### Key Differences

| Feature                        | File Merge SOP                        | Folder-Based File Importer         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **File Selection**              | Manual selection of files             | Automatically scans folders and subdirectories |
| **File Filtering**              | Requires filtering after selection    | Supports file format filtering during the scan |
| **Performance**                 | Slower with large or nested datasets  | Fast and efficient with parallel processing |
| **User Interface**              | Less intuitive                        | Dynamic interface with clear feedback |

### Folder Merge SOP:
- Requires manual selection of files.
- Suitable for small datasets but becomes slow and inconvenient when dealing with large file sets or nested folders.

### Folder-Based File Importer:
- Automatically scans folders and subdirectories.
- Supports file format filtering, ignoring unnecessary data.
- Speeds up the import process and reduces manual tasks, saving significant time for the user.
